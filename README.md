# algo-animator

An interactive program to visualize sorting algorithms. Developed in C using OpenGL, GLUT and FreeType. I also made a video about this project -> [Youtube](https://youtu.be/KvOI88s-FsU).

This project is inspired by the video of Timo Bingmann called [15 sorting algorithms in 6 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg)

## Usage

### Compile

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

Currently I've only tested this project on Linux. However, I would like to prepare it so that it can be used on Mac and Windows. However, my cross-platform experience is almost non-existent. Maybe in the future I'll check how to do it.

### Run

To customize the program you can pass the following arguments.

    ./algo_animator WINDOW_WIDTH WINDOW_HEIGHT RECTANGLE_WIDTH SPACE_BETWEEN_RECTANGLES

The default values are:

    WINDOW_WIDTH = 1920
    WINDOW_HEIGHT = 1080
    RECTANGLE_WIDTH = 5
    SPACE_BETWEEN_RECTANGLES = 1

Run the program in a window with width of 1920 pixels and height of 1080 pixels, fit the screen with rectangles with width of 50 pixels, and add a space between rectangles of 3 pixels.

    ./algo_animator 1920 1080 50 3

# Notes

This project has not been designed to compare the speed of the algorithms side by side. The main objective is the visualization of the algorithms for educational purposes.
